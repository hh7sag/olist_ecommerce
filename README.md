## Overview
For Olist projects, there are 8 datasets in total, but I only use 2 datasets including customers dataset and products datasets to analyze product changes based on total number of orders (key metric) and successful orders (supporting metric)

+ Customer dataset: It has 99441 customers with 5 columns of ID, unique_ID, zip_code_prefix, city and states in Brazil

+ Product dataset: It has 32951 products with nearly 72 product categories and other product features such as photo quantity, name length, description length, weight, length, width and height
